/*
  This program populates a MongoDB database with information about companies by processing local files
  to generate objects that additional information is appended to via requests to wikirates for that
  company's aliases as well as its Greenscore.

  Due to the number of queries performed and the existence of timeouts for their failure, this program
  will take around five minutes to complete. It uploads ~4000 documents to the specified database, and
  writes to the console to alert the user of its progress.

  tldr; takes 5 minutes to complete. (287.686 seconds in my test case)

  In order of Behavior:
   - Read local Files
     - Master List to generate all unique objects immediately
     - 4 Files that have additional information which is appended to the previously generated company objects
  - Query Wikirates for the Aliases associated to each company
    - Will sometimes miss due to the name not being correct, can't do much about that. Many will hit, though.
  - Query Wikirates for the Greenscore values associated to each company
    - Again, will sometimes miss but previously obtained data from the 4 Files gives us some context.
  - Connect to MongoDB Database, retrieve Collection, and insert all Company objects as Documents to it

  Further Work:
    - Decide if we want to filter the produced company list by those which have wikirates pages; this could
    potentially help remove duplicate company objects that have one another as aliases, or simply remove
    companies that we don't have much information on.
